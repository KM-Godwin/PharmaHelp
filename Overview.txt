A system to store the stock of medicine, perform operations on the stock i.e. adding, removing or replacing, with each sale of the day. It should read the barcode of a drug and know what type it is. 

Objective:
Make stock taking a lot easier(main)
	other objectives:
 - Check availability of medicine,
 - Compute the worth of medicine
 - Perform invoices on drugs sold
 - Manage payment taken during the day(classify between mpesa and cash)
 # The above should be specified while selling the drug.
 # Use query filtered search to display the amount paid in cash and in e-cash
 # For ease of payment, create a qr code scanner to automatically send an stk push to mpesa (optional)(put after prototype is done)


Requirements:
- A scanner(use a camera instead)
- A good computer(4gb of ram will suffice, internet connectivity)
- A good sql database
- A well set connection between the system and database


I will use django for this project. Try as much as possible to make each objective a module working on its own
